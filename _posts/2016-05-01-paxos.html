  <p class="edge">The main result of the <a class="link" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf">Paxos Made Simple<a> paper by Leslie Lamport is an algorithm to transform any <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">finite-state machine (FSM)</a> into a fault-tolerant distributed system.</p>

  <p>It sounds complicated, but with the step-by-step <a class="link" href="http://rystsov.info/evil-scheduler/paxos.html">visualization</a> and this post I'm going to demystify its complexity.</p>

  <a href="http://rystsov.info/evil-scheduler/paxos.html"><img src="/images/paxos.png" width="700"/></a>

  <p>Let us start with the FSM. It's a fancy name for a pretty wide class of applications. How wide is it? If you can model your computation as a pure function from a state and an event into a new state, and you have a fixed limit on the size of each state/event then your computation (your application) belong to the FSM class.</p>

  <p>You can guess that almost any web application using three-tier architecture matches the description: the stateless servers play the role of the pure function while the size of the database is limited by the storage capacity.</p>

  <p>Now it should be clear <b>why Paxos is important:</b> it allows to convert almost any application into a distributed system to achieve more reliability than each individual node provides.</p>

  <p>The paper was written in <span class="num">2001</span> and it contains several ground-breaking ideas:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Leslie Lamport demonstrated how to build two linearizable distributed data structures:
      <ul>
        <li>a distributed write-once register</li>
        <li>a distributed append-only log</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>He suggested to use distributed append-only log to store the sequence of all events leading a system to the current state instead of storing the state itself (later this idea was rediscovered as the event sourcing pattern).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In <span class="num">2016</span> it feels natural to use logs for FSM (see ZooKeeper, Etcd, Raft). But logs aren't the first thing that I want to work with as an engineer because they force me to implement garbage collection and snapshots (nasty stuff, see the <a class="link" href="http://research.google.com/archive/paxos_made_live.html">Paxos Made Live</a> paper by Google). Also it's possible to imagine how distributed data structures other than logs could model FSM. I wonder if they really exist and why FSMs implemented on top of them aren't known...</p>

  <ul>
      <li>They do exist. For example, <a class="link" href="http://treode.github.io/">TreodeDB</a> used this approach. It's interesting that I haven't seen any academic paper dedicated to this <!-- define this --> idea, but I saw several industry systems built with it. So I practiced my Math-Fu, described and proved FSM over Single Decree Paxos in the <a class="link" href="http://rystsov.info/2015/09/16/how-paxos-works.html">How Paxos Works</a> post.</li>

      <li>IMHO the log-based solutions are more popular because they had the advantage of time. Until Vertical Paxos was published in <span class="num">2009</span>, log replication was the only consensus protocol capable of cluster membership change. Thus, it was the only practical solution for highly available services. But now we have a few more algorithms to choose from. For example Vertical Paxos and Raft's joint consensus membership change are among them. Take a look at the <a class="link" href="http://rystsov.info/2016/01/05/raft-paxos.html">Best of both worlds: Raft's joint consensus + Single Decree Paxos</a> post if you're interested in understanding how dynamic membership works with a distributed variable <!-- distributed variable? Either I'm missing something, or it's not clear what this means in this context -->.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Visualization</h4>

  <p>Now that we understand that there is a place for alternative distributed FSMs, let's discuss the visualization. We're going to visualize the work of a distributed FSM managing an intercontinental ballistic missile launch system.</p>

  <h5>FSM</h5>

  <p>Imagine that we want to model an intercontinental ballistic missile launch system with the following rules:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The missile is launched when at least two generals signed off the launch.</li>
    <li>Until the missile is launched a general can revoke their sign-off.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The (non-distributed) FSM engine may look like</p>

  {% gist rystsov/1221d05bebf70197b6dd0b08d335a86a %}

  <p>And the state transition functions are:</p>

  {% gist rystsov/3c3efd10754cc8f585ed5710f9a0cebc %}

  <p>The rules define the possible states of the system, while the actual state is defined by the generals' behavior. It's quite simple in our example:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>unsign the launch</li>
    <li>sign the launch</li>
    <li>goto 1</li>
  </ol>

  <h5>Distributed FSM</h5>

  <p>Distributed FSM has several endpoints <!-- define endpoints --> with the <code>execute</code> service, but it doesn't matter which endpoint you choose because the system behaves exactly like a system with several endpoints but leading to the same (non-distributed) FSM. <!-- refactor this whole sentence, perhaps split it to 2 or more smaller sentences --> The only difference is that the distributed version runs on <span class="num">2n+1</span> nodes and tolerates up to <span class="num">n</span> failures.</p>

  <h5>Visualization</h5>

  <p>The visualization consists of two code columns and a side view with data. The first column contains the code of a distributed Single Decree Paxos FSM engine (36 lines of code); while the second column is dedicated for the state transition functions and the generals behavior (33 lines of code).</p>

  <!-- so put the pictures here? Or embed the whole visualization? -->

  <p>It’s worth to mention that the state transition functions weren't changed at all, so it is extremely easy to convert an existing FSM into a DFSM. Incidentaly, the actions in the example look like message handlers in the actor model, so FSM over SDP looks like a great way to store the state of actors from Akka or Orleans frameworks.</p>
